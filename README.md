# Kaggle-Plant-Pathology-Competition
This folder shares my work for the Kaggle Plant Pathology Competition which is designed to engage students in the advanced field of agricultural disease detection using machine learning. Utilizing a dataset originally from the Kaggle Plant Pathology 2021 FGVC8 competition, participants will develop models to accurately classify different plant diseases in crops, with a focus on improving agricultural outcomes.

For more details refer to the original competition link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/plant-pathology-2021-fgvc8.

## Description
### Objective
The primary objective is to develop a deep-learning model that can classify plant diseases based on images. Participants will use the provided training dataset, which consists of images resized to a maximum dimension of 600 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio. The challenge is to use these images to train models that can accurately classify plant diseases in the test set.

### Data Description
#### Source: Derived from the Plant Pathology 2021 - FGVC8 Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/plant-pathology-2021-fgvc8).
#### Training Set: Publicly available images, resized with the largest dimension capped at 600 pixels. The dataset includes various classes of plant diseases.
#### Test Set: A separate set of images, similarly processed, to be used for evaluating the models.
